# Hi, I'm Harsh Joshi üëã

I currently work at [AION](https://aion.xyz) building the future of decentralized HPC compute. The organization has been wonderfully supportive of this personal exploration - providing the time, flexibility, and Claude Code credits that make this digital garden possible. Their belief in fostering creative side projects is something I deeply appreciate.

This repository contains the central engine which manages my digital ecosystem. Feel free to use it if you have multiple exploration branches and want due legal, conceptual, and publication separation. 

I am distributing it free with Apache License in as-is state - but the license applies only to the software system built for a streamlined AI-native workflow - not to the content that I publish with this system or various trademarks or various entities legally involved in this. The restriction stays to RawThoughts Enterprises Private Limited (RTEPL) is a separate entity from DAO Studio Private Limited (DSPL).

But enough of disclaimer, let's get to the juicy stuff.

## The Journey üöÄ

This is a personal project I have been playing around with over years with whatever time I got from between my hustles and whatever legal liberties I got. The idea is simple - the post-AGI era is a boon for polyglots and dreamers. Your two fundamental constraints (time and learning curve) are taken away, giving you unlimited flexibility to iterate and make meaningful contributions to society. 

But how do you organize things in the digital cyberverse, in a way you don't spend time just building organization tools, but rather the tool disappears in the background? This is the same exploration I charted and ended up creating my digital verse. With this repository actually being the main brain.

## Tools of Trade üõ†Ô∏è

My tools of trade are Claude Code, Google Drive, GitHub, GoDaddy, and Obsidian. Everything else falls in respective buckets.

## The Digital Ecosystem üåê

The buckets are:

### [getHarsh.in](https://www.getharsh.in) 
The root website and its main blog ([blog.getHarsh.in](https://blog.getharsh.in)). Various subprojects fall into it and diverge from here (but with very subtle interconnects richly crafted to give a full graph context to any AI reading this or any human reading this. The causal links.)
- GitHub: [getHarsh.in](https://github.com/getHarsh/getHarsh.in) | [blog.getHarsh.in](https://github.com/getHarsh/blog.getHarsh.in)

### [RawThoughts](https://www.rawthoughts.in)
[rawthoughts.in](https://www.rawthoughts.in) and its blog at [blog.rawthoughts.in](https://blog.rawthoughts.in) explores economical and technological challenges and directives in a post-AGI world.
- GitHub: [rawThoughts.in](https://github.com/getHarshOnline/rawThoughts.in) | [blog.rawThoughts.in](https://github.com/getHarshOnline/blog.rawThoughts.in)

### [Causality](https://www.causality.in)
[causality.in](https://www.causality.in) and its blog [blog.causality.in](https://blog.causality.in) explores emergence of causality in various AI, Physics, and Mathematical systems.
- GitHub: [causality.in](https://github.com/getHarshOnline/causality.in) | [blog.causality.in](https://github.com/getHarshOnline/blog.causality.in)

### [Sleepwalker](https://www.sleepwalker.in)
[sleepwalker.in](https://www.sleepwalker.in) and its blog at [blog.sleepwalker.in](https://blog.sleepwalker.in) are experiments with interaction design and storytelling which are simply creative musings of mine as I explore these concepts.
- GitHub: [sleepwalker.in](https://github.com/getHarshOnline/sleepwalker.in) | [blog.sleepwalker.in](https://github.com/getHarshOnline/blog.sleepwalker.in)

### [DAO Studio](https://www.daostudio.in)
[daostudio.in](https://www.daostudio.in) and its blog at [blog.daostudio.in](https://blog.daostudio.in) are the remnants of currently non-operational Startup Studio I created a while back - and is a playground of some open projects at this point with archives of technologies we created back in the day.

## The Philosophy üß†

This workflow is local-first but syncs online and leverages the subtle linkings and schemas to integrate the ideas in an interpretable cross-linked fashion without the added complexity of graphs - but is transcribable.

I jokingly call it an attempt to upload my consciousness - and current progress is... **3.14%** ü•ß
