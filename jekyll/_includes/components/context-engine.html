  Central Context Engine
  
  This is the core intelligence system that extracts context from all sources
  and makes it available to all components.
  
  Universal Context includes:
  - Static configuration (ecosystem, domain, blog, project)
  - Dynamic signals (page, content, component)
  - Semantic intelligence (content type, audience, difficulty)
  - Target awareness (repository context, build mode)
  
  Usage:
  {% include components/context-engine.html %}
  Then access: universal_context.semantics.contentType, etc.
